- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to use different platforms to code so I can analyze data better
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with understanding how to use git and github to help my coding
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about sports and the outdoors
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: my email is jd@gardnerweb.net
- âš¡ Fun fact: I severed my nerve in my left middle finger so I don't have full sensation there.
